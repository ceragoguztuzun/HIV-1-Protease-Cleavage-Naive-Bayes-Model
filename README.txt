Code is to be run using python3.
I ran my code using Ubuntu 18 LTS - 64 bit.

Code is executed by typing 'python3 q3main.py'


There are many division by 0 warnings as output. Apart from them the outputs belongs to the answers I found for each question of homework, they are also written in my report. Matplotlib plots come up as popups the code continues execution when one closes those popups.
